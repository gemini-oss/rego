# Regolith (ReGo): The Foundation for Simplified Multi-Service API Interactions

Regolith, or ReGo, is an open-source Go-based application built to serve as a blanket layer over your API workflows, simplifying interactions with multiple REST APIs from various services like Okta, Google, Atlassian, and more. The term `Regolith` combines two Greek words: rhegos (ῥῆγος), 'blanket', and lithos (λίθος), 'rock'. ReGo provides a robust foundation for inter-service operations with dedicated service clients and helper functions.

## Why ReGo?
Working with multiple REST APIs, each with their unique specifics, can be challenging. ReGo addresses this complexity by establishing a solid, maintainable foundation for managing these interactions. Much like the geological regolith provides a base for celestial bodies, our Regolith creates a structured package for each service along with common helper functionalities, simplifying your inter-service operations and API workflows.

## Main Features
- Service-specific clients: Dedicated clients for each service streamline HTTP requests and JSON handling into detailed entities.
- Automated Documentation: Leverages [gomarkdoc](https://github.com/princjef/gomarkdoc) to automatically transform code comments into Markdown documentation.
- Common Helper Functions: Common helper functionalities enhance code reusability and maintainability.
- Universally Applicable Code: The code doesn't rely on any company-specific logic, making it usable by any individual or company interacting with the services.
- Foundation for Compliance-as-Code: While initially conceived to streamline/solve internal challenges, the codebase is versatile enough to lay the groundwork for initiatives such as compliance-as-code.
